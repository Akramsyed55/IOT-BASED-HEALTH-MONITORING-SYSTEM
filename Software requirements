Technical Requirements:
Interoperability: Ensure compatibility and interoperability among different IoT
devices, sensors, and platforms to facilitate seamless data exchange and integration
with existing healthcare IT systems.

Scalability: Design the system to accommodate a growing number of connected
devices and users, allowing for scalability to meet future healthcare monitoring
needs.

Reliability and Resilience: Implement robust networking infrastructure and fault-
tolerant mechanisms to ensure reliable data transmission and system availability,
even in the event of network disruptions or device failures.

Data Security: Employ encryption, authentication, access controls, and other
security measures to protect patient data privacy and confidentiality, adhering to
regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and GDPR (General Data Protection
Regulation).

Real-time Data Processing: Enable real-time processing and analysis of
healthcare data to support timely decision-making and interventions, leveraging edge
computing and cloud-based analytics platforms as needed.

Functional Requirements:
Remote Patient Monitoring: Enable continuous monitoring of patients' vital signs,
symptoms, and health metrics using IoT devices such as wearable sensors, smart
home monitoring systems, and medical devices.

Alerting and Notifications: Implement alerting mechanisms to notify healthcare
providers and patients of abnormal health conditions, deviations from predefined
thresholds, or critical events requiring immediate attention.

Data Visualization and Reporting: Provide intuitive dashboards, charts, and
reports to visualize and analyze healthcare data, enabling healthcare professionals
to gain insights into patient trends, outcomes, and performance indicators.

Patient Engagement Features: Include features such as medication reminders,
health goal tracking, educational content, and interactive communication channels to
engage patients in their own healthcare management and promote adherence to
treatment plans.
