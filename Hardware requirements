IoT Devices:

Wearable Sensors: Devices such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, or medical-
grade wearables equipped with sensors for monitoring vital signs (e.g., heart rate,
blood pressure, oxygen saturation), activity levels, and other health metrics.

Environmental Sensors: Sensors for monitoring environmental factors that may
affect health, such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and noise levels.

Communication Modules: Wireless communication modules (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-
Fi, cellular) for establishing connectivity between IoT devices, gateway devices, and
backend servers.

User Interfaces:

Mobile Devices: Smartphones, tablets, or other mobile devices used by patients
to access mobile apps for viewing health data, receiving notifications, setting health
goals, and engaging in self-management activities.

Desktop Computers: Computers used by healthcare providers to access web-
based dashboards, electronic health record (EHR) systems, or clinical decision
support tools for reviewing patient data, monitoring trends, and making informed
decisions.
