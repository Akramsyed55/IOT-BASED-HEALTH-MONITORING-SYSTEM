# IOT-BASED-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEM
Internet of Things (IoT) is the new revolution of internet which is the growing research area especially in the health care.

This presents a review of smart health monitoring systems and an
overview of their design and modelling. Furthermore, a critical analysis of the
efficiency, clinical acceptability, strategies and recommendations on improving
current health monitoring systems will be presented In order to achieve this, over fifty
different monitoring systems have been selected, categorized, classified and
compared.

IoT-enabled healthcare monitoring involves the use of connected devices, such
as wearable sensors, medical-grade monitors, and environmental sensors, to collect
and transmit data on patients' vital signs, symptoms, and health metrics. These
devices capture a wealth of physiological data, including heart rate, blood pressure,
oxygen saturation, glucose levels, activity levels, and sleep patterns, providing
valuable insights into patients' health status and trends.

One of the key advantages of IoT-enabled healthcare monitoring is its ability to
facilitate early detection of health issues and timely interventions, thereby preventing
complications, reducing hospitalizations, and improving overall health outcomes. By
continuously monitoring patients' health status outside of traditional healthcare
settings, healthcare providers can intervene proactively when abnormalities or
deviations from normal health parameters are detected, leading to more effective
and targeted treatment plans.

Objective: Enable healthcare providers to remotely monitor patients' health status
and vital signs outside of traditional clinical settings.
